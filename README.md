MIPS-Simulator
==============

Generates the assembly code and instruction-by-instruction simulation of the MIPS code.

In this project a simple MIPS simulator was developed which performs the following two tasks:

 Generates the assembly code equivalent to the MIPS text input file(disassembler).

 Generates the instruction-by-instruction simulation of the MIPS code (simulator). 
It also produces the contents of registers and data memories after execution of each instruction. 

Exception/interrupt handling during simulation was not implemented.

Sample files have been uploaded for reference.
